# MCMC Methods Exploration

A repository for exploring Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods through theory, pseudocode, and interactive Jupyter Notebook implementations. This project covers various MCMC algorithms, including Importance Sampling, Metropolisâ€“Hastings, Gibbs Sampling, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), and the Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA), with relevant theoretical foundations and practical use cases.

## Overview

This repository contains:
- **Algorithm Implementations:** Clear pseudocode and Python implementations for key MCMC methods.
- **Real-World Applications:** Notebook demonstrating applications in Bayesian linear regression, audio signal reconstruction, image reconstruction using HMC, and implicit neural representations (Neural SDF) with MALA.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Required Python libraries:
  - NumPy
  - SciPy
  - Matplotlib
  - PyTorch (for neural SDF examples)

You can install the required libraries via the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> Note: this repository is still a work in progress, especially the notebook part
